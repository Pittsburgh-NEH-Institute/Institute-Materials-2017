# Filename conventions for Institute repo

Rule | Example (or explanation)
---- | ----
Separate parts (words and numbers) with underscores (not hyphens) | `regex_2.md` (not `regex-2.md` or `regex2.md`)
No capitalization (Jupyter notebook filenames are an exception to this rule) | `regex_2.md` (not `Regex_2.md`)
No superfluous words (e.g., `day`, `clinic`; weekly and daily plans are an exception to this rule) | `python_1.md` (not `python_clinic_day_1.md`)
All images go in `images` subdirectory for that week | (no images in actual week subdirectory)

# Week 2, Day 2: Tuesday, July 18
## Synopsis

The first half of Week 2, Day 2 continues the focus on document modeling from the previous day, with attention to three models of text: XML (text as tree), LMNL (text as ranges), and TAG (text as graph). The second half of the day introduces the idea of developing a digital edition as a computational pipeline. We illustrate the pipeline with the Gothenburg model of textual variation, and then begin to explore the first two stages of that model, tokenization and normalization.

## 4:00–5:30: Normalization

Before we start: 1. Navigate to your fork of our Institute repo and run `git pull upstream remote`. 2. Start Jupyter notebook either from the Anaconda launcher or by navigating to your home directory and typing `jupyter notebook`. 3. Within the main Jupyter notebook web page, navigate to schedule/week_2 in your fork of our repo and open `Normalization.ipynb`, `Unicode-normalization.ipynb`, `Normalization_examples.ipynb`, and `Integrating_XML_with_Python.ipynb`.

Time | Topic | Type

We’ll end each day with a request for feedback, based on a general version of the day’s outcome goals, and we’ll try to adapt on the fly to your responses. Please complete [# Week 2, Day 2 feedback](week_2_day_2_feedback.md) (just copy and paste it into a plain-text document) and email your response to Kaylen at [kaylensanders@pitt.edu](mailto:kaylensanders@pitt.edu) with the subject heading “# Week 2, Day 2 feedback”.

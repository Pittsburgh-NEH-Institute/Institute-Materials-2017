# Week 2, Day 2: Tuesday, July 18

## Synopsis

The first half of Week 2, Day 2 continues the focus on document modeling from the previous day, with attention to three models of text: XML (text as tree), LMNL (text as ranges), and TAG (text as graph). The second half of the day introduces the idea of developing a digital edition as a computational pipeline. We illustrate the pipeline with the Gothenburg model of textual variation, and then begin to explore the first two stages of that model, tokenization and normalization.

## Outcome goals

## 9:00–10:30: Theory of edition

Are you making an edition of a manuscript or of a text? What is the role of language and orthography in your edition? How will the text be presented? How will users interact with the views? What will be the role of graphic visualization?

# Week 2, Day 3: Wednesday, July 19

## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 3 expands upon the idea of digital editions as text processing pipelines. After a short recap of day 2, we continue with the step normalization. We will show how these two pipeline stages prepare texts for automated collation. The process of automated collation is also discussed from a modeling perspective (GM). Participants learn that their research goals and questions influence the computational pipelines.

# Week 2, Day 4: Thursday, July 20
## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 4 concentrates on ...

## Outcome goals
* Grasping the concept of modelling text as trees and graphs Understanding annotation as a form of adding layers to text Varieties of layered editions
* Deeper discussion of the alignment step in the GM An awareness of computation to understand that we do near-matching late (in the pipeline) for reasons of efficiency
## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

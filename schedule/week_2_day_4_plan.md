# Week 2, Day 4: Thursday, July 20

## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 4 concentrates on ...

## Outcome goals

* Grasping the concept of modelling text as trees and graphs Understanding annotation as a form of adding layers to text Varieties of layered editions

* Deeper discussion of the alignment step in the GM An awareness of computation to understand that we do near-matching late (in the pipeline) for reasons of efficiency

# Publishing Strategies and Sustainability

Lots and lots of options...

 * How interactive do you want your edition to be?
 * What kinds of data do you want to marshal for your edition?
 * How dynamic do you want your web service to be?
 * What will your audience want and/or expect?
 * What can you rely on third parties for and what will you have to implement yourself?


## Sustainability

### War stories
  * <http://papyri.info/docs/ddbdp> — Success through adversity (and the application of a **lot** of money)
  * [James Lawrence Dusenbery Papers](http://wayback.archive-it.org/3491/20170215141416/http://docsouth.unc.edu/dusenbery/), formerly at <http://docsouth.unc.edu/browse/collections.html> — experimental but unsustainable

### Strategies
 * Smart development, stupid publishing
 * Graceful degradation / Think about accessibility
 * Let your data be promiscuous
 * OPEN LICENSES!
 * DOCUMENTATION!
 * Have a business model for your project
 * Make strategic partnerships

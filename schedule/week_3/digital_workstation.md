# The digital workstation

## What is a digital edition?

The critical edition is an important part of many scholarly projects. A digital edition, which includes the critical material, context, and _____ of the print edition, has the potential to be
so much more intuitive than a print book could. Digital editions, which can range from the simple HTML interface of a Project Gutenberg book to the advanced lightbox feature of the Blake Archive, 
can be designed to facilitate multiple research questions, and therefore more accessible to many different scholars.  

## What is a digital workstation?

The digital workstation improves on the concept of the digital edition by creating an interface to facilitate discovery.
The ease with which one flips through a print edition to find a remembered line is lost in the digital interface, but that 
does not necessarily mean the digital interface is not easy to use. Through intuitive design, integration of features, and _______________,
the digital workstation makes research easier and faster.

Simply put, a digital edition is meant to be read, and a digital workstation is meant to be used.

### Features

The best features for a digital workstation varies greatly depending on the text itself. Manuscripts and unique texts often benefit from a digital recreation of a physical object.
Examples of this type of workstation include the [Blake Archive](http://www.blakearchive.org/) and [the Perseus Digital Library]()http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2008.01.0590, which rely on high quality scans of original materials. These workstations
also include zoom, comparison, annotation, and light-box-like features, which enrich the user's interaction with the text. Workstations can also emphasize metadata, or contextual information about the text, through hover or clickable links. A great example of this is the [Repertorium of Old Bulgarian Literature and Letters](http://repertorium.obdurodon.org/).

### Design

Designing the interface challenges the scholar to anticipate research needs for themselves and others. The digital workstation should be intuitive to use. Each step in the research process should be accounted for,
with the designer asking, "Where should we go next?" For some projects, this means never needing to hit the back button or never needing to scroll. Every element of design should enhance user experience, which can be difficult
when you consider the diversity of users.

# XSLT

To start with, some setup. In a terminal:

1. In the same folder where you cloned your Institute repo, do `https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets.git`
2. Get the path for that folder and copy it.
3. Run `docker run --name pitt -v <INSERT THE PATH YOU COPIED>:/pitt -it teic/teidev-docker`

For a full set of documentation on building and testing the TEI Guidelines and Stylesheets, see <http://teic.github.io/TCW/testing_and_building.html>.

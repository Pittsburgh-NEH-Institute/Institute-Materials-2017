Topics for the week that will have to be taught if they haven't already been introduced:

# Linked Open Data

Not currently in Week 1 or Week 22, and I think it may be more of a publishing (Week 3) topic anyway. Together with IIIF? Possibly relevant, all from Jeffrey Witt about scholastic commentaries:

1. [Lombard Press](http://lombardpress.org/)
2. Graz presentation about [publishing editions as data, rather than as documents](http://lombardpress.org/2016/11/02/dse-and-api-consuming-applications/)
3. [The Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive](http://scta.info), and especially the [technical details](http://scta.info/technical-details)

# RDF

Also not in Week 1 or 2. Cover together with Linked Open Data?

# Git and GitHub

Part of Week 1; see tutorial and resources in the Week 1 directory.

# Javascript (for CETEIcean)

Not currently in Week 1 or Week 2. We have room for web technologies (overview of HTML [including flavors], CSS, Javascript, PHP) in Week 1, if you think we should include them. How much Javascript do you think we should cover? How much do they need? How much is realistic?

# Using the TEI Stylesheets

This sounds to me like a Week 3 topic, since itâ€™s publication-oriented.

# HTTP (for APIs)

Week 1 includes a couple of sessions on how the Internet works, including HTTP. Tara is overseeing those, so you may want to coordiate with her.

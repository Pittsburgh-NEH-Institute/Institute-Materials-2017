# OLD: Configuring Alexandria

NB: These installation instructions are no longer applicable. We keep them for archiving purposes. For up-to-date installation instructions and a tutorial about how to use _Alexandria_, see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HuygensING/alexandria-markup-server).


1. Install Docker
	* _Mac (Yosemite 10.10.3 or later)_: Docker CE (community edition) for Mac from <https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac>
	* _Mac (Older than Yosemite 10.10.3)_: Docker toolbox for Mac <https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/DockerToolbox.pkg>
	* _Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise_: Docker CE for Windows <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>. **Please note that Hyper-V *should only be enabled* which Docker does for you at installation time. It is probably that you do not have _Virtualization_ enabled in your BIOS if there is an error about this. In BIOS it could be named _VT-X_/_AMD-v_ or simply _Virtualization_. 
	* _Windows 10 Home, Windows 8, Windows 7_: Docker Toolbox: this installs Docker into a GNU/Linux system in a VirtualBox <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows> (direct link <https://download.docker.com/win/stable/DockerToolbox.exe>)
	* _GNU/Linux_: Install Docker via your package manager.

2. Create a directory and copy the following file (which must be called `docker-compose.yml`) into it:

```
version: '3'
services:
  # the alexandria server
  alexandria:
        image: huygensing/alexandria-markup-server:latest
        ports:
          - 8002:8080
          - 8003:8081
        environment:
          - BASE_URI=http://localhost:8002

  # the tex-util server, which can convert the LaTeX from the alexandria server to SVG)
  latex:
        image: huygensing/tex-util-server:latest
        ports:
          - 8000:8080
          - 8001:8081
        depends_on:
          - alexandria
        environment:
          - BASE_URI= http://localhost:8000

  # the relevant notebooks and python code to connect to the alexandria and latex services
  notebook:
        image: huygensing/alexandria-markup-notebook:latest
        ports:
          - 8888:8888
        depends_on:
          - latex
          - alexandria
        volumes:
          # Your work notebooks will be stored here
          - /Users/djb/docker:/work
```

1. Change the last line to specify your own workspace by replacing the “djb” with your own userid. If not on Docker CE (Modern Macs, Windows Entreprise) and on Docker Toolbox instead (old Macs, Windows Home) also change the two occurrences of “localhost“ to the ip address of your Docker. 

2. Create a subdirectory called `docker` under your home directory.

1. If you are using ports 8000, 8001, 8002, 8003, or 8888 on your machine for other purposes (you probably aren’t), you need to change the ports Alexandria uses. The only numbers you have to change are for the ports you are using, and only in the following two types of situations:

	1. The numbers after the colons in the lines that set a value for `BASE_URI`.

	1. The numbers *before* the colons in the lines that have two port numbers separated by a colon. Do not change the numbers *after* the colons in these lines, even if you are using ports with those numbers for other purposes.

1. In the directory where you saved `docker-compose.yml`, run:

	```
	docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
	```

1. In a web browser, navigate to either <http://localhost:8888> or <http://ipaddress.of.your.docker:8888> (This is an ip address starting with either 192. or 172. E.g. 172.17.0.1).
1. Click on the “examples” directory and then on the notebook “markup-init.ipynb”. 
1. When on a modern Mac and running Docker CE change the server_url and latex_server in the *first cell* of the notebook to "http://docker.for.mac.localhost:8002" and "http://docker.for.mac.localhost:8000/" respectively.
1. When not on Docker CE and on Docker Toolbox instead if required also *change* the ip/host address to that of your docker as above in the *first cell* of the notebook.
1. Run the notebook from the menu bar with “Cell” → “Run All”.

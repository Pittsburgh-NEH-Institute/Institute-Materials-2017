And from this freſh water Sea vnto <span class="hi">Paria,</span> the coaſt lieth weaſt northweaſt, and all full of ſholdes that the ſhippes can not come neare to the land.

This countrey of <span class="hi">Sancta Marta</span> is a countrey that is watered by ſluces, and the corne and things which they ſowe <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note38">Sancta Marta.</span> and plant, they doe water, with their owne labour: it is an o­pen grounde, and hath hight mountaynes, and without any thing growing in them. The ſande of the riuers is altogether ſtony ſande, of the colour of golde, and it ſheweth as though that it were al gold. There are in this Ilande many Hogges, and much Deare. There is found in the powre of the <span class="hi">Indians,</span> much gold and coper, and alſo much gilt Coper. The <span class="hi">Indians</span> do ſay that they gilte the Coper with an hearbe that grow­eth in that countrey, whiche beyng ſtamped, and the iuyce ta­ken out, and the Coper beyng waſhed therewith and put to the fire, it turneth to the colour of moſt fine gold, and it riſeth more or leſſe in colour, accordyng to the quātitie of the hearbe that is put to it. The people be fearce and warlike, they vſe bowes, and their arrowes be little bigger than quarrels, which they annoynt with an hearbe that is ſo full of poyſon, that it is a great chaunce (when they hit any man) if he eſcape, beyng wounded with that hearbe: one of the things wherewith they make that hearb, are certaine apples which be in that coūtrey, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note39">Appels of poyſon.</span> &amp; are of the greatneſſe and colour of the wilde Apples of this coūtrie. The tree that doth carry them is like to a ſmall Peare tree of this coūtrie. As ſone as any mā hath eaten one of thē, immediatly it turneth to wormes within his body, whiche grow ſo great &amp; eate ſo muche of the bodie, that they kill him: this is knowen to be ſo by reaſon. I cauſed it to be experimen­ted, in one that was giuen to a Dogge to eate, whiche within foure houres was turned all into wormes in the body, and ſo we found it when we cauſed the Dogge to be opened, for to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1451"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5891&amp;page=11">[Page 15]</a></span> ſee the effect of the Apple. And if any man do put himſelfe vn­der one of theſe trees in the ſhadowe, immediatly his head be­ginneth to ake: &amp; if he do continue there long, his face begin­neth to ſwell, &amp; to trouble his ſight: and if by chaunce he ſleepe vnder the tree, immediatly he loſeth his ſight: all this I haue ſeene by experience. Before you come to <span class="hi">Sancta Marta</span> there is <span class="hi">Yaharo,</span> which is in the ſide of the ſnowie mountaynes. <span class="hi">Ya­haro</span> as a good port and ſtandeth in a good countrey: and there <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note40">Yaharo.</span> be Orchardes of trees of diuers ſortes of fruytes to be eaten, &amp; among them there is one like to Oringes, &amp; when the fruite is in ſeaſon to be eaten it turneth yellow, and the meate that is within it is like to butter: It hath a good ſauour, and hath the taſt ſo good &amp; ſo ſoft, that it is maruelous. The moūtaines that lie full of Snow, beginne from <span class="hi">Sancta Marta:</span> and neare to <span class="hi">Yaharo</span> is the higheſt parte of them, and they ſhew vpon the toppes as white as if they were Snowe, and from thence they reache to <span class="hi">Veneciuela,</span> and ſo into the countrey within, it is not <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note41">Moūtayns vvith Snovve.</span> knowen how farre, for that the coūtrie is not yet in ſubiectiō, nor the <span class="hi">Indians</span> do giue any more reaſon of them, but that they reache very farre into the countrie. This Mountayne is vpō the toppe playne, and there be many townes of <span class="hi">Indians</span> vpō it, and many lakes of ſtanding water. In <span class="hi">Sancta Marta</span> is ga­thered much Cotton wooll, and the <span class="hi">Indians</span> do make ſtore of clothe of it, whiche is a thing to be ſeene, and they make it of many colours: they do make of Popingayes fethers, Pecocks and of other birdes which be in that countrey, certaine things like to Diademes, very great, that the gētlewomen do put on their heades, which things hang downe vpon their ſhoulders in one peece vnto their girdle: like to the ends of a biſhops Mi­tre: &amp; this is ſo well wrought, that it is maruell to ſee the di­uerſitie of the colours, and the worke, and the arte thereof: and as the colours be naturall and of themſelues, they ſhewe ſo wel, that no artificiall worke of ſuch as is wrought here, is ſo good nor ſo acceptable vnto the ſight.

There be alſo many other beaſtes. I toke that Towne, which was the firſt that was taken in that Countrey, and I ſaw all theſe beaſts, and it was told me, that they had ſene Ownees.

I hap­pened to kill y<sup>e</sup> firſt that was killed, &amp; I ſaw caſt at hym more than tenne Launces, and as they ſtrake vpō him, they reboun­ded, as though they had ſtricken vpō a Rocke. And after that, a ſeruant of mine went athwart of hym, and thruſt him at one blowe into the middeſt of his body, and then we killed hym, and being dead and taken on lande, we found that he had vpon his backe from his necke to the tayle a ſhell that couered hym all, whiche was ſo ſtrong, that no Launce coulde paſſe it: and vnder that from the middle of the body downewarde neere to the guttes, he was as other Lyzards are, and by that parte of his body he was thruſt in with the Launce. His mouth was three ſpannes long from the ſnoute to the lower end of y<sup>e</sup> teeth: he had in a ſide two rewes of teeth, the moſt fierce that I haue ſeene, or had bin ſeene by any of them that were with me. He was fleyne &amp; his fleſh was eatē, it was white &amp; good, &amp; ſmelled like to muſke, and good in eating. I ſaw alſo y<sup>e</sup> fleſh of Tigres &amp; of Lions.

The Lizardes be ingendred in thoſe egges, and after they make a hole in them, and they come forth of the egges in­to the ſandes, and ſo they goe into the water. The egges be as greate as a Gooſe egge, and greater. They haue no ſhelles, but certayne ſkynnes. They be good to eate, and of a good ſauoure, &amp; euery Lizard doth lay at one tyme lx. or lxx. egges.

Their fleſhe is good and ſweete: and others that are as little as grey Spar­rowes, which be greene and faire. In this countrey are greate fiſhings of good fiſh: and alſo there be Date trees that do carry frute as greate as a Doues egge, ſome yellow, and other of the Roſe coloure, but they haue greate ſtones: their taſt is ſomewhat ſharp. In this Countrey are little beaſtes like to Pigges of a month olde, theſe haue their feete and heads lyke to a little Horſe, with little eares, and they be all couered with a ſhell from the eares to the tayle, and be like to a Horſe coue­red.

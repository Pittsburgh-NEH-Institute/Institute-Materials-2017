            <ab>Simale, the mother of Herophantos, to Zenon, greeting. Since I heard that my boy had been mistreated and rather badly, I came to you and after arriving I wanted to petition you about these matters. But when Olympichos prevented me from seeing you, somehow I was brought in the presence of my child and I found him lying down in a hardly laughable state and seeing him was enough for me to grieve. But when Olympichos arrived he said that by beating him rotten he would make him--or that he had already made him--as someone who was already nearly decent. Thus I beg and beseech you to concern yourself with these matters and to report to Apollonios in which way my child has been continuously maltreated by Olympichos as if he were responsible for his illness. For I, in addition to the fact that I have received exactly nothing for a year already except for the mina and 3 artabs of wheat since the month Dystros when Herophantos has come to you--The boy himself tells me of the goodwill of Apollonios and yourself that you keep on showing to him. I ask you, therefore, and beg you that, if Apollonios has ordered to pay him anything, his wages be paid to me. Rest assured that as soon as the god sets him free I shall bring him back to you so that I may see you with regard to the rest. Learn the rest from the person who brings you this letter, for he is not a stranger to us. Farewell.</ab>

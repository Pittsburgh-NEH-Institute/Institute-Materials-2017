            <ab>To Flavius .... the most distinguished prefect (?) ---, from Aurelia Tapais daughter Heras [and Allous, from] the village of Karanis of the Arsinoite Nome. Having submitted a most just request to your highness, lord prefect, I am of good hope of receiving help from your highness. I give witness to the following, that Antiouris [son of Abous] and Atisios son of Leonides from the same village of Karanis carried out a most unlawful deed against me, which the laws instruct your highness to invalidate. --- against me, who am a minor and an orphan --- my maternal four arouras --- to a certain scribe Didymos --- For it is necessary --- carrying out she could sell --- my maternal nine and a half arouras located near the [same] village of Karanis. But he made the other and ... contract in this sale which he did not pay in full (?), seeking possession of them according to law; --- therefore the laws as aforesaid, and the ... invalidate these contracts especially since they are concocted in fraudulent intention against minors. For this reason having reached your fortunate rule I flee to your feet, a needy orphan child, and I (ask?] you, if I am telling the truth in these matters that you instruct Ptolemaios --- for the illegal sale which has taken place to be invalid, and to give to me the ownership of the plots so that receiving this I may be able to have their benefit and be eternallv grateful to vou. Farewell. I, Aurelia Tapaeis, have submitted it. I Aurelios Dioskoros, wrote for her being illiterate.</ab>

            <ab>	Memorandum to Zenon from Phamounis, boat captain.You ordered Sosos to go down to the river and take over the boat from me. It is already the third day, however, that he has not come; and already I have had to sell my chiton in order that the workmen may have what is needed. You know that Proitos has gone away with all that I had. I beg you, therefore, if it seems advisable to you, to send someone who will take over the boat. There are six of us in the boat. And it is necessary that I take them back again to the place from which I brought them. If you can assist me with some money, I will restore it to you as seems best to you, in order that I may not have to sell my garments and that I may be released as soon as possible. 
								Good-bye.
[Verso:]						Phamounis.

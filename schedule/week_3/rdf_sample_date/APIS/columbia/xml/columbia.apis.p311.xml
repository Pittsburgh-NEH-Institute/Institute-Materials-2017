            <ab>Tourbon to his brother Dioskoros many greetings. Before all else I pray that you are in good health. I am well myself. Every day I make obeisance for you in the presence of our lord Sarapis. I want you to know, brother, that having found an opportunity I deemed it necessary to write you this letter, indeed my second one. You yourself did not write back to me even a single letter. You should take thought, brother, as I enjoined you when I was leaving you, not to be careless, knowing that, if you neglect it a little, we will lose them and . . . you will communicate . . . (send me) a cloak and other things. Try to get busy and send me these things very quickly, if he (?) sends them to you. If not, then be more zealous: raise for me the pig of which I have talked to you until it . . . or when it happens, you will write to me. I greet your wife and your children.  I greet Herakles, I greet . . . Petaiesis and Thermouthas and her children. I greet also Sarapias and Keias and her children, I greet Pt(olemaios?) and his wife, I greet all the people who love us.
</ab>

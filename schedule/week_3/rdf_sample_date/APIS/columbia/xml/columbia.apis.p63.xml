            <ab>X to Zenon, greeting. If You and your friends are well, and everything else is as you desire, it would be as I pray to the gods. I myself am well.  (Since ?) you stood sponsor (?) for me, I am trying - - - (to be of service ?) to Nikanor and (because I have surpassed ?) the rest of his assistants, he has admitted me to his full confidence, having conformed to my own attitude (in this respect). I think that he, too, will continue (in this attitude ?) toward me. Be kind enough to write without delay both to Nikanor and to Hekataios, I am worthy of you who provided the introduction. Krotos will give you further assurance of my good will toward you. For in every matter in which he has been calling upon me, I have helped him blamelessly, and whatever he has needed I have done ungrudgingly for your sake. 
							Best wishes.
 
 [Verso:] To Zenon.

            <ab>	Nomikos (?). We are speaking on behalf of Sambathion and Heras, of the village of Karanis. In the previous census records our clients registered considerable land of different categories in the territory of the village of Karanis in the Arsinoite (Nome), viz. Sambathion ninety arouras of royal and ten of private land, and Heras ninety of royal. But after the reservoir collapsed and the land was no longer being watered, it came to pass that these arouras remained unsown and brought an enormous loss upon our clients. With them in dire straits on this account, the collectors add a still greater injury. For Alexandros and Heraklas--his heirs are here present--registered in that area an enormous amount of land, and this was then being farmed by some fellow-villagers, and as they have become fugitives the collectors are improperly attacking these (our clients) and are compelling them, who are neither owners nor registrants nor holders (of the land), to pay the taxes--which they ought properly to collect from those who registered and own it and contracted these obligations, but they have proceeded instead against law-abiding peasants. We beg this high court, inasmuch as the very census records are in hand in which the lands are proved to belong to none other than Heraklas and Alexandros, that they, living in the city, be compelled to acknowledge their liability for the taxes of the lands and that our clients not be troubled, inasmuch as the former, being very powerful and oppressive in the region, are inflicting their own taxes upon the peasantry. 

(In the margin) 
	Our clients: Sanbathion and Heras, of the village of Karanis. 
	Opponents: Alexandros and heirs of Heraklas. 
	They registered in the census records: 
		Sanbathion 	royal 90 ar. 
				private 10 ar. 
		and Heras 	royal 90 ar. 

	But after the reservoir collapsed and the lands [came to be] in dry state, the collectors pressured them not only for their own property but also for Alexandros' on the pretext [they had farmed the land of that person?] a long time before. . . . [The actual farmers] have resorted to flight, but they were able to return as they (the collectors) again pressured them to farm it, and they are pressuring these (our clients). We beg (you), since registrations already exist and the owners are here present, to order ... and to compel them to direct their demand to the (actual) farmers. Our clients ... names. 
	The farmers farmed: 
		Orsenouphis 16 
		Soueis 20 
		Asklas 5 
		Heras 5
		Panouphis 2
		Kastor  4 1/2
		Heron 2 1/2 

(Docket on verso)
 On behalf of Sambathion of the village of Karanis, Horion, advocate.

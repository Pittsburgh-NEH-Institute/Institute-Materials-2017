cu500 | 1 | Written across the fibers; some writing on the front
cu500 | 2 | 9 lines of writing on the back by an "evolving" hand
cu500 | 3 | The back of the papyrus was reused for the exercise when it was already somewhat damaged and a section of the fibers had stripped away
cu500 | 4 | It is uncertain whether there was another col. of writing preceding this or the student started his exercise in mid-sentence, as sometimes happens
cu500 | 5 | The student seems to have practised letters of the alphabet in the upper margin of the front, which was free from writing; here there are also 2 extensive cancellations (or ink stains); on the bottom there are remains of 1 line by a different, small, documentary hand

cu300 | 1 | 2papyri ; 50.9 x 21.6 + 88.8 x 21.6 cm
cu500 | 1 | Written across the fibers; on the front P.Col. V 1 recto 1a + 1b
cu500 | 2 | Four and a half cols. of writing with 88 lines in 1b; 7 cols. with 105 lines of writing in 1a
cu500 | 3 | 1b is written in a careless cursive hand
cu500 | 4 | 1a is written in a clear vertical hand that is the same as the hand of BGU IX 1894, a similar document which is more detailed and contains an account for the toparchy
cu500 | 5 | The register of 1b contains unpaid remainders, some of which were probably arrears
cu500 | 6 | Sometimes in 1b the name of the tax called "geometria" is not given
cu500 | 7 | In 1b are listed 40 Arsinoites, seven of whom were given official titles, which replaced patronymics
cu500 | 8 | Lines 5-50 of 1a contain payments charged to the "current year," while the second section lists receipts charged to the preceding year
cu500 | 9 | The names that appear in 1b were copied from a larger register, in the order in which they appeared there, and are not in alphabetical order; the larger register probably contained the names of all holders of land in the area of Theadelphia with assessments and payments with dates

cu510_dd | 11 | P.Col.:5:1
cu520 | 12 | List of metropolites in 1b: each name is followed by the names of taxes and amounts of money; most taxes fall under the category of garden and vineyard taxes. In 1a there are balances of tax collections in money without the names of the individual taxpayers; this document is not an official report, it is rather the work sheet of the tax collectors

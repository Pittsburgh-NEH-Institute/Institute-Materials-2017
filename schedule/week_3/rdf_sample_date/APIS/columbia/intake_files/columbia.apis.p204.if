cu500_t | 5 | To Valerius Ziper, the most distinguished praeses Aegypti Herculiae, from Aurelius  Isidoros son of Ptolemaios, from the village of Karanis of the Arsinoite Nome. In the month of Phamenoth in the consulate of Sabinus and Rufinus, my lord praeses, Kastor and his brother Ammonianus, inhabitants of the same village, having fallen into need borrowed from me thirty-two artabas of wheat and eighteen (artabas) of kidney-beans, and they gave me a note for these, mortgaging three oxen as security. On the same day, their  brother-in-law Tomis executed in my behalf a contract-bond by which he undertook the security of the oxen, so that if they [Kastor and Ammonianus] did not effect the delivery of  the produce to me within the month of Pauni, I was clearly to acquire ownership of the oxen, in accordance with the bond.

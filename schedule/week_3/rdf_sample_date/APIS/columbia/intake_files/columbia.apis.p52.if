cu500_t | 4 | Ne?sis to Zenon greeting. I went to Herakleopolis to give money to the workmen. So I gave it to them and sent to Philadelphia four employees and six hired workmen in order that they might serve under me. You wrote to Petobastis to give me 100 drachmas. I have received from him 60 drachmas. I am leaving the money there so that the shop may not be idle, and it will be necessary to us that the shop be not idle.

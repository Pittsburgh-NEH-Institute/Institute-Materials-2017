cu500_t | 1 | Philotas to Zenon, greeting. _____ has asked me to write to you regarding the slaves which ran away from _____. But I have not done so because my time has been consumed by Apollophanes and _____ himself (who demanded) that I assist them in dealing with the tax farmers and pay to _____ ______ as soon as possible (what is owing to them). When I went for this purpose to Herodes the tax farmer I found that ____ had already made an agreement with him to pay  in full a tax of 80 drachmas to Apollophanes. Therefore I first annulled the contract; and I am making another contract to pay half to Apollophanes, so that I have taken 40 drachmas off the tax agreed upon; and I have come to an agreement with (Herodes regarding the incidental fees?) And I brought in the slaves to Herakleides and gave (them over to him [?], since) he said that he would guard them. He did not permit me to conduct the affair though I wished (to guard them myself). I have therefore written to you that you may be informed. You would do me a favor by purchasing and sending to me the things about which (I have already written) you. You also write regarding any favors which you may desire, (knowing that I will do them for you) eagerly.     Year  28, Panemos 27    [Verso, docket:] From Philotas.        To Zenon.

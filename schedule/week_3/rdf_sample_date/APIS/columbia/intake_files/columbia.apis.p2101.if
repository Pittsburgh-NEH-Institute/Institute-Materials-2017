cu300 | 1 | two leaf shapped fragments of perforated paper ; 10 x 14.8; 10 x 14 cm.

cu500 | 2 | Multiple texts and scripts, some upside down relative to others
cu500 | 3 | Large script is a good 3rd cent. AH hand   
cu500 | 4 | Other piece has tiny account hand
cu500 | 5 | Unglassed
cu520 | 1 | Upside down small script from one of the two pieces may have been an account, "six dirhams" below which, "dirham and a third"; the other side of two, that with only one text, large script on one piece, very small on other.

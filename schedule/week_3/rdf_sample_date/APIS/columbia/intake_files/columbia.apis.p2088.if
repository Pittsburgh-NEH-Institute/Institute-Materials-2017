cu245f | 1 | [8th-10th cent. AH] 
cu300 | 1 | 1 paper ; 43 x 26.5cm
cu500 | 1 | 4 line tughra, alif 5 cm., 19 lines, first 11 complete, bottom faded
cu500 | 2 | 8 cm. right margin
cu500 | 3 | One line written down the right margin, up against the text, and 3 2-3 line subcriptions, possibly names, grouped under that line.
cu500 | 4 | Traces of main lines extending across the right margin may be from the document having been folded and the ink soaking into the margin, or the document may be a palimpsest
cu500 | 5 | The left margin is damaged but nearly complete
cu500 | 6 | Bottom margin probably lost, date would have been here
cu500 | 7 | Mamluk document reminiscent of those published by Wainsborough, Richards, et.al., and to those in Oriental Institute Collection (Chicago), but not as elegant
cu500 | 8 | Comparatively poor quality paper, and only 1.25 cm. between the lines. Good script, though difficult to read because of the ink running and giving an out of focus appearance that is compounded by fading. 
cu500 | 9 | Unglassed
cu520 | 1 | Mamluk document; in line 5 of the text reference to al-bani atrak, and in line 9 to al-iqta' of the sultan; remains of larger Tughra on the other side, with letters 6 cm. tall

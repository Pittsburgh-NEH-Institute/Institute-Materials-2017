# Command line 1 (Windows)
* The three Command Line lessons are based on the wonderful [Software Carpentry's materials](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). 
* **Windows users** will work through a **special breakout session** for Command Line 1 only. We will cover:

## What is the *shell*? Why and how do we use it?

* The *shell* is a program that runs other programs, typically in a Unix environment. <!--Emphasize that the shell is still a program, which takes input and gives output. The input is a command, though, so it seems as though we’re doing something different. In reality, using command line is no different than using any other program.-->
* We use the shell to interact with the computer on the command line (CLI ~ GUI).
* The command-line-based window that runs a shell is called a *console* or a *terminal*. 
* The Unix philosophy is that you can _pipe_ (chain) together small commands, each of which does one thing well, to do something complex. You can’t do this in a GUI.
* bash = ‘Bourne again shell’ (the original Bourne shell is sh; others include csh, ksh, tcsh, zsh). <!--We use and recommend bash (Git Bash). There are many different shells, some of which you end up downloading with program packages like Python.-->
* Learn the shell on a need-to-know basis. <!--There are commands you’ll use every day, some you’ll use for special purposes (and you’ll look up how they work when you need them), and some that you’ll never need.-->


## Our choice of shell: git bash

* We will be learning the **bash** shell. 
* When you downloaded Git, you also downloaded **Git bash** <[screenshot](images/command_1_gitbash.png)>, the command line interface.
* You may have been using `cmd.exe` <[screenshot](images/getting_to_know_cmd.png)> or Windows Powershell <[screenshot](images/command_1_powershell.png)>, both native to Windows. Though each has its own benefits and drawbacks, for the purposes of this institute we will have all Windows users learn and use Git `bash`.
	* You might have heard of [“Ubuntu Bash on Windows 10”](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about). We do not recommend it—ask us why later! 
* Why is learning `bash` a good idea? 	

## Git bash vs. Windows command lines vs. regular bash


* The Git `bash` filesystem adopts a Unix-like convention: it uses `/` as the path separator, and absolute paths start with `/c/`, `/d/`, etc. (So, `/c/Users/narae` instead of `C:\Users\narae` in `cmd`.) 
* Git `bash` is missing some commands that are included in regular `bash`, e.g., `nano`, `sudo`, and `man`.
	* `nano` is a text editor. You can substitute Notepad, which you can run using `notepad myfile.txt`. 
	* `sudo` allows you to change features that require elevated administrative permissions. (If you ever get to try it, use it with caution.)
	* `man` displays a command manual, and there is no equivalent in Git `bash`. You can look up commands on line at <https://ss64.com/bash/>. 
* Git `bash` requires the use of `winpty` when running certain Windows applications that are meant to run within `cmd`. For example, to run an interactive python session, you should execute `winpty python`. 

## Getting oriented

* If you type a command and find yourself on a blank line with nothing happening: you typed an incomplete command, and should **abort** it with `Ctrl+c`. 
* When you *see* `$` (shell prompt): the shell is waiting for you to provide input. 
* When you *type* `$`: you’re beginning to type a variable name. 
* When you *see* `>` (shell continuation prompt): you’ve started entering multiple-line input, and the shell is waiting for the next line. Abort if this not what you meant to do. 
* When you *type* `>`: you’re writing output into a file, instead of displaying it on the screen. More on this in Command Line 2. 


## Files and directories
* We will work from the Software Carpentry lessons: 
  * [2. Navigating Files and Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/)
  * [3. Working with Files and Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/)

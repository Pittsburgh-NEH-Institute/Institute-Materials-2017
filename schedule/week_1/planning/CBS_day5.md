##Day 5: Documentation and Error Messages

###Close reading of error messages

   * Making things go wrong on purpose
   * Errors without a message
   * Google is your friend!
###Documentation and man pages

   * Regular expression documentation: \url{https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html\_node/find\_html/egrep-regular-expression-syntax.html} 
   * An exercise in reading a man page
   * Finding the information you want (cat man page: \url{http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html} , ls man page: \url{http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html} )
   * Transferring the knowledge you've gained elsewhere
###Review

   * The command line, file paths, an assortment of useful commands
   * A very brief primer on the Internet
   * Regular expressions and complex search 
   * How these things crop up in developer idiom
   * I said I'd come back to: What was going on with that [[:digit:]] backreference
   * I said I'd come back to: How to grep for single quotes, dollar signs, etc.
###Project 

   * install Mallet (\url{http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php} )!
   * Get stuck, get a chocolate
       * Download package and open it
       * on Windows: set environment variable $MALLET\_HOME (use % instead of $ on Windows old style) to point to the mallet-directory
       * run **bin/mallet import-dir --input sample-data/web/* --output web.mallet** --> you'll be asked to install the Java developers kit - do that
       * run command again
       * if output is
                               * Labels = 
                               *    sample-data/web/de
                               *    sample-data/web/enthen you're done!   


   * This is an exercise in running into problems and resolving them, not an exercise in showing how skilled you are!

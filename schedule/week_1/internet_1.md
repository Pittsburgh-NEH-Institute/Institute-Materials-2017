# How the Internet works, part 1

## Hostnames and DNS

* What happens when you register a hostname
* Making a DNS query: `host` and `dig`
* Things other than A records: aliases and mail

## Internet addresses

* What are IP addresses?
* Why have we run out of IPv4 addresses?
* IPv6 and its sloooowww adoption
* localhost and private IP addresses

## Network communication

* Computers run programs, which *listen* at *ports*
* Port: a number that tells the computer which program to send the message to
* Restricted ports: 0-1023
* Registered ports: everything in /etc/services
* Once you learn enough Python, you too can write a program that listens at a port!

## Network protocols

* This is how computer programs talk to each other
* Much like shells, programs have their own language that they expect
* Example! Talking to a mail server

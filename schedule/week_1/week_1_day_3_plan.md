# Week 1, Day 3: Wednesday, July 12

## Synopsis

Day three kicks off with a deeper look at refining regular expressions to tailor patterns to specific research needs. Day three introduces `grep`, which applies regex to operating on the command line. Day three also introduces Python and covers the basics of its text processing capabilities. 

## Outcome goals

* Creating regular expressions for more complicated search patterns
* Using regex and the command line collaboratively
* Where does `grep` fall short and how can we get around this
* Facility with Python and NLTK
* Processing a text file in Python

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

______

## 9:00–10:30: [Regular expressions 2](regex2.md)

## 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

## 11:00–12:30: [Command line 3](command_line_3_djb.md)

With regular expressions under our belt, we are ready to learn advanced `grep` skills for the command line. We will explore how we can search for lines that match a pattern and how to exploit advanced features (and work around complications) of this utility. We will also learn about the `find` command. 

The Software Carpentry activities associated with the Command line 3 session are:

* [5. Loops](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/)
* [7. Finding Things ](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/)

## 12:30–2:00 Lunch

## 2:00-3:30: [Python clinic 1](Python_Clinic_Day_1.html)

The first day of the Python clinic will introduce the basics of text processing, in preparation for more complex textual analysis in the continuation of this unit. We will introduce and discuss the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and the role it plays in processing text files. Participants will also gain familiarity with the Jupyter Notebook environment.

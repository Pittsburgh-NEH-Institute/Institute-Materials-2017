# Week 1, Day 1: Monday, July 10

## Synopsis

Welcome to the NEH “Make *your* edition” Institute: models and methods for digital textual scholarship. The first week is a bootcamp for operating on the command line and other baseline skills. Day one begins with learning about your operating system. We then move beyond the graphical user interface (GUI) and begin to use the command line, which allows greater control of the files, directories, and programs that populate a filesystem. Day one emphasizes knowledge of the computer as a tool for managing information.

## Outcome goals
* Know your machine: Windows, Mac, and Linux users will all have different experiences and knowledge. Sometimes (= much of the time) the steps toward completing a task or solving a problem may depend on the operating system
* What are files, directories, and programs
* Directory navigation and file manipulation
* Creating and saving aliases
* Understanding and dealing with error messages

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

______

## 9:00–10:30: Getting to know your OS ([Windows](getting_to_know_windows.md)) ([Mac](getting_to_know_mac.md))

Windows and Mac users will split into breakout groups so that participants can focus on how to work in their specific environments. How does your OS both facilitate and inhibit your work now, and how might that change?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ---- | ----
15 min | Introduction and technology setup | Presentation
25 min | Your machine, your files | Talk lab
25 min | Navigating through the filesystem | Code lab
25 min | External drives, administration, and system variables | Presentation

## 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

## 11:00–12:30: Command line 1

What is a shell? How do we use it? In breakout groups, we begin working at the command line by navigating through our filesystems a step at a time.

* [Mac OS](command_line_1_djb.md) (in Alumni Hall 531)
* [Windows](command1_windows.md) (in Alumni Hall 528)

The Software Carpentry activities associated with the Mac Command line 1 session are

* [1. Introducing the Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/)
* [2. Navigating Files and Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/)
* [3. Working with Files and Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/)

## 12:30–2:00 Lunch

## 2:00–3:30: [Programs and files 1](programs_and_files1.md)
Now that we know where to find them and what they are, how can we manipulate and use files and dirctories for our benefit?

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ---- | ----
15 min | File types | Presentation
30 min | Character sets, Unicode, and text editors | Code lab
25 min | Operating system conventions | Code lab
20 min | A shell is just a program | Code lab

## 3:30–4:00: Coffee break

## 4:00–5:30: Dealing with errors

## Homework

We’ll end each day with a request for feedback, based on a general version of the day’s outcome goals, and we’ll try to adapt on the fly to your responses. Please complete [Week 1, Day 1 feedback](week_1_day_1_feedback.md) (just copy and paste it into a plain-text document) and email your response to Kaylen at [kaylensanders@pitt.edu](mailto:kaylensanders@pitt.edu) with the subject heading “Week 1, Day 1 feedback”.

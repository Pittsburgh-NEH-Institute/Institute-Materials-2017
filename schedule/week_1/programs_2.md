# Programs and files 2

## Repeating things and variables

Declare a variable with just it’s name, but refer to it with a leading `$`. Example: `for file in *.txt; do wc -l $file; done`. The preceding declares a variable called `file`, which will be equal to all files in the current directory that end in “.txt” and then reports the number of lines in each. 

In the first example below `%` removes a matching string at the end of the filename. These commands make copies, but if you replace `cp` with `mv`, they rename files.

* `for file in *.txt; do cp ${file%txt}bak; done` replace “.txt” extension with “.bak”
* `for file in *.txt; do cp $file $file.bak; done` keep “.txt”, but add “.bak” after it

## The environment

* `env`: show all environment variables
* `$PATH`: list of directories where the shell looks for executable files, starting at the beginning
* `echo $PATH`: show the value of the `$PATH` variable

## The execution path (`$PATH`)

* Your working directory is not automatically in your path. Why might that be the case? 
* To execute a file in the current directory, specify the directory as part of the command, e.g., `./command` runs a command called `command` that’s located in the current working directory.

## Finding commands and files

* `help`: list all shell built-ins
* `which`: search `$PATH`, one result (the one that will be executed if you type the command), not for shell built-ins or aliases
* `whereis`: search standard locations, multiple results, not for shell built-ins or aliases
* `find / -name java -print 2> /dev/null`: find all files named `java` starting at the file system root, not for shell built-ins or aliases
* `type`: includes shell built-ins and aliases!

## System locale (`$LOCALE` and `$LC_*`)

* How to find your locale: the `locale` command
* What the different LC_* variables are for
* What happens when your locale changes: playing with `date`

## Spreadsheets, CSV, and hidden traps therein

* What is CSV and TSV (comma- and tab-separated value) format?
* What does that have to do with your locale?

## Misc

* `diff` and `wdiff`

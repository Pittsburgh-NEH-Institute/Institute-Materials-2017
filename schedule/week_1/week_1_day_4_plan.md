# Week 1, Day 4: Thursday, July 13

## Synopsis

Day 4 begins with an introduction to how the Internet works, a topic that will recur when we turn to publishing in Week 3. This day also introduces the version management system Git (which, among other things, hosts all materials for our Institute). We conclude with more advanced Python activities within Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome goals
* Understand how communication over the Internet works
* Understand why version control matters
* Understand the Git workflow
* Become comfortable with command line Git
* Know how to clone a Git repo
* Process text corpora with Python

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

## 11:00–12:30: [Git 1](git_tutorial.md)

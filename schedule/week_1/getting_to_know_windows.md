# Monday, 9:00–10:30: Getting to know your OS: file and directory system (Windows)

[Introduction; verify that everyone’s Internet connections work]


## File system hierarchy 

* What are files?
* What are directories/folders? <!--Thinking about why we call them folders: a folder and a piece of paper are the same, and can do some of the same things. A folder can also hold pieces of paper.-->
* What are programs? <!--Programs are files that can do something, but are still files nonetheless. Take a piece of paper out of your folder, fold it into an airplane, and throw it. It's still a piece of paper you can read from and write on, but it can fly.-->
* GUI file explorers and file hierarchy



## Configuring your machine to show filename extensions

* <[screenshot](images/getting_to_know_winconfig.png)> In any File Explorer window, click on “View” tab, and then “Options” on the right to open the “Folder Options” window. 
	* In the “View” tab, uncheck “Hide extensions for known file types” box.

## Configuring your machine to show hidden files, and more

* <[screenshot](images/getting_to_know_winconfig.png)> In the same “Folder Options” window as before, 
	* Check “Show hidden files, folders, and drives”. 
		* NOTE: Protected operating system files will still stay hidden.  
	* Also check “Display the full path in the title bar” (not essential, but recommended).


## About files

* Why are some files hidden? <!--If you change something, however small, in some of these files, you can break your computer. Be careful!-->
* **Case sensitive** vs **case preserving**
	* Linux is **case sensitive**, meaning files with the same name but different capitalization are different files (e.g., `finalpaper.txt` is different than `FinalPaper.txt`). 
	* Mac OS and Windows are **case preserving**, but not case sensitive. <!-- (This preference can be changed when configuring the filesystem, but certain programs will not run in a case sensitive environment, so it’s best to leave it alone). A case preserving file system will spell the filename as you type it, but if you create a different file with a name that differs only in capitalization, it will overwrite the first one. We recommend not creating filenames that differ only in capitalization even on Linux; not only is it potentially confusing, but you may be collaborating on a project with someone not on Linux. -->
* **Spaces** in a file and directory names. Why could these be problematic? 


## Launching a terminal

* The Command Prompt **cmd.exe** <[screenshot](images/getting_to_know_cmd.png)> is the native Windows console, which grew out of DOS.  We will be using it in this session. 
	* How to launch: from the Start menu type in “cmd”. 
	* NOTE: For later sessions and the remainder of this institute we will be using the **bash shell** instead, which you downloaded and installed as part of Git. This is the command line interface we use and recommend.


## Moving through a filesystem
<!-- Move the programs and files stuff in here, use cmd.exe -->
<!-- where is home?  both in cmd and in gui-->
<!-- language differences for gui and command line-->

* Navigate up and down, with emphasis on the paths in the title bar <!-- We should clarify that Git Bash will use forward slashes rather than backslashes, and explain later when we introduce cmd why that's the case.-->
* Drive letter in Windows: `C:\Users` (Windows `cmd`)
	* Drive letter elsewhere: `/c/Users` (Windows Git `bash`), `/Users` (no drive letter in Mac OS and Linux)
* `cd`: change directory <!--Open a command line and begin using `cd`. Explain that `cd` is essentially the same as selecting or clicking a folder. `cd` into your home directory.-->
* `dir`: list all files


## File/directory path in File Explorer GUI vs. cmd 

* Matching the GUI file path with the file/directory path in the terminal
* User-specific directories: where are your home directory, document folder, and desktop? What are their full file/directory paths? 
* Non-English OS’s may have translation/localization applied, but only on the GUI side! 
	* In Spanish Windows, a user’s Documents folder would appear in File Explorer as “Usarios > jeremy > Documentos”
	* The same folder will appear on the command line as `C:\Users\jeremy\Documents`

## External drives and mounting
How removable and external drives (such as a USB thumbdrive) are treated in GUI vs. terminal environment

* In Windows, they are assigned a new drive letter: `d:\` `e:\` (cmd)
* In Git bash environment (will learn this later), they look like: `/d/` `/e/` 

 	
## How to run a program as an administrator

* Right click on a program icon (say, Command Prompt) and select “Run as administrator”. 
	* **CAUTION!** You may accidentally break your system by removing essential files or directories.
	* Use only when you have a good reason to; close program when done. 


## Environment variables (aka system variables)

* How to view environment variables through a GUI
	* File Explorer -> Right click on 'This PC', select 'Properties' -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables 
* How to view environment variables in a terminal
	* In `cmd`, type in: `set`

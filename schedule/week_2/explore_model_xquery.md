# Exploring the model with XQuery
We have previously seen different ways to represent our models.
We have a set of xml documents:


* [test.xml](test.xml)
* [test1.xml](test1.xml)
* [ozymandias.xml](ozymandias.xml)
* [ozymandias_2.xml](ozymandias_2.xml)
* [hamlet.xml](hamlet.xml)

We will explore them with XQuery in eXist-db. [eXist-db.org homepage](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html)
Direct download: <https://bintray.com/existdb/releases/exist/3.3.0/view>

eXist-db 3.3.0 requires Java SE 1.8, so if you did not install it earlier this week (or have it installed) please do so now: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html> 

To our help we are going to use eXide the integrated development environment (IDE) for eXist-db. After you installed (and potentially also require an start) it you find it here: <http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/eXide/index.html>
You have all function help available locoally but also on our demo server: <http://demo.exist-db.org/exist/apps/fundocs/index.html>. You can also run eXide on our demoserver if you just want to follow along without any installation right now.

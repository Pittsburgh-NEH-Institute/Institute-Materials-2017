# Week 2, Day 4: Thursday, July 20
## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 4 Mike Kestemont joins the instructional team to teach bag of words and text processing. Unfortunately, Mike is unable to publish materials used during this institute online due to copyright issues, so for now we will link his excellent presentations instead.

## Outcome goals
* Grasping the concept of modelling text as trees and graphs
* Understanding annotation as a form of adding layers to text
* Varieties of layered editions
* Deeper discussion of the alignment step in the GM
* An awareness of computation to understand that we do near-matching late (in the pipeline) for reasons of efficiency
## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

We’ll end each day with a request for feedback, based on a general version of the day’s outcome goals, and we’ll try to adapt on the fly to your responses. Please complete [Week 2, Day 4 feedback](week_2_day_4_feedback.md) (just copy and paste it into a plain-text document) and email your response to Kaylen at [kaylensanders@pitt.edu](mailto:kaylensanders@pitt.edu) with the subject heading “Week 2, Day 4 feedback”.

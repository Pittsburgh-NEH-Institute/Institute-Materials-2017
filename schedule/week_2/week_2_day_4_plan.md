# Week 2, Day 4: Thursday, July 20

## Synopsis

At the beginning of Week 2, Day 4, Mike Kestemont introduces text analytics with Python, concentrating on *bag of words* methods. In the afternoon we continue our earlier examination of collation and then begin to explore documents using XQuery within the eXist XML database.

## Outcome goals

## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

## 3:30–4:00: Coffee break

## 4:00–5:30: Modeling: exploring the model with XQuery

<!-- ### Topics and Activities
* Recap of the topics that have been discussed so far: tokenization, normalization, and collation from the point of view of annotations (as each of these activities entails a form of annotation)
* Envisioning your edition as a layered model
* Existing models (e.g. computational linguitics) 
* Hands-on: identify your own layers
* Hands-on: model your edition's pipeline

### Outcome goals
* Grasping the concept of modelling text as trees and graphs
* Understanding annotation as a form of adding layers to text
* Varieties of layered editions
* -->

* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

-------

## 9:00–10:30: Text analytics 1

MK: Bag of words, text processing, text as tables, query the tables

### Outcome goals
* _[some text here]_

## 10:30–11:00: Coffee break

### Outcome goals
* Have more energy

## 11:00–12:30: Text analytics 1 (cont.)

MK: Bag of words, text processing, text as tables, query the tables (continued)

#### Outcome goals
* _[some text here]_


## 12:30–2:00: Lunch

## 2:00–3:30: Modeling: annotations as layers to the text

### Topics and Activities
* Recap of the topics that have been discussed so far: tokenization, normalization, and collation from the point of view of annotations (as each of these activities entails a form of annotation)
* Envisioning your edition as a layered model
* Existing models (e.g. computational linguitics) 
* Hands-on: identify your own layers
* Hands-on: model your edition's pipeline

### Outcome goals
* Grasping the concept of modelling text as trees and graphs
* Understanding annotation as a form of adding layers to text
* Varieties of layered editions

## 3:30–4:00: Coffee break

## 4:00–5:30: Collation 2

### Topics and Activities
* Advanced collation
* Near-matching - theory (as step in the computational pipeline) 
* **Hands-on**: ...

### Outcome goals
* Deeper discussion of the alignment step in the GM
* An awareness of computation to understand that we do near-matching late (in the pipeline) for reasons of efficiency.

# Week 2, Day 5: Friday, July 21
## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 5 concentrates on querying text, on creating visualizations, and on presenting research outcomes to the end user. After desigining and implementing the content of your edition, after adding layers of information to your model, we think about how to query the information and how to present it to an audience. It means that the content need to be made accessible in a way that does not require an end user to code.

## Outcome goals
* Learning XQuery to ...
* Visualization as part of the text processing pipeline: making decisions, selecting formats, interacting with, and producing visualizations Hands-on: a departure from Word Cloud

# Week 2, Day 5: Friday, July 21
## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 5 concentrates on querying text, on creating visualizations, and on
                presenting research outcomes to the end user. After desigining and implementing the
                content of your edition, after adding layers of information to your model, we think
                about how to query the information and how to present it to an audience. It means
                that the content need to be made accessible in a way that does not require an end
                user to code.

## Outcome goals
* Introduction to XQuery
* Familiarity with FLWOR statements
* Visualization as part of the text processing pipeline: making decisions, selecting formats, interacting with, and producing visualizations
* Hands-on: a departure from Word Cloud
## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

## 4:00–5:30: Visualization as outcome

In the last section, we’ll discuss [visualization as a view](https://github.com/Pittsburgh-NEH-Institute/Institute-Materials-2017/blob/master/schedule/week_2/visualization_as_view.md) on your text. We will also make you familiar with different [visualization formats](https://github.com/Pittsburgh-NEH-Institute/Institute-Materials-2017/blob/master/schedule/week_2/visualization_formats.md).

Time | Topic | Type
---- | ---- | ---- 
90 min | Getting from layered annotations to (a specific) visualization | Discussion

We’ll end each day with a request for feedback, based on a general version of the day’s outcome goals, and we’ll try to adapt on the fly to your responses. Please complete [Week 2, Day 5 feedback](week_2_day_5_feedback.md) (just copy and paste it into a plain-text document) and email your response to Kaylen at [kaylensanders@pitt.edu](mailto:kaylensanders@pitt.edu) with the subject heading “Week 2, Day 5 feedback”.

# Week 2, Day 5: Friday, July 21

## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 5 concentrates on querying text, on creating visualizations, and on presenting research outcomes to the end user. After desigining and implementing the content of your edition, after adding layers of information to your model, we think about how to query the information and how to present it to an audience. It means that the content need to be made accessible in a way that does not require an end user to code. We conclude with a general review and an opportunity to catch up on topics we were not able to see to completion earlier in the week.

# Edition terms and concepts

## What is an edition?

* Edition as *digital workstation*
* *Silicon paper*
* The role of the interface; interface as scholarship
* Reader-oriented theory of edition

## What goes into an edition?

* Manuscript as object ~ witness to text
* Work ~ text ~ redaction
* Orthography ~ language
* Language (of the scribe ~ of the text)
* Documentary ~ analytical functions
* Research result ~ research resource
* Transcription principles

## The traditional shape of the edition

### Editions of manuscripts

* Facsimile (image)
* Diplomatic (transcription)
* Genetic, e.g., [Shelley-Godwin Archive](http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/sc/oxford/frankenstein/volume/i/#/p2)

### Critical editions of texts

### Interlinear collation

* Example: [Rus′ primary chronicle](http://pvl.obdurodon.org/browser.xhtml)

### Copy text with notes (apparatus)

* Example: [St. Patrick’s *Confessio*](http://www.confessio.ie/etexts/confessio_latin#02)

### “Best witness” ~ dynamic critical text:

> An editor of no judgment, perpetually confronted with a couple of MSS. to choose from, cannot but feel in every fibre of his being that he is a donkey between two bundles of hay. What shall I do now? Leave criticism to the critics, you might say, and betake himself to any honest trade for which he is less unfit. But he prefers a more flattering solution: he confusedly imagines that if one bundle of hay is removed he will cease to be a donkey. (A. E. Housman, *Selected prose.* Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961.)

### Apparatus types

* _Apparatus fontium et locorum parallelorum_ “contains references to those texts that served as source for the edited text—this includes also the Bible—and to texts that cannot have been used as a source, but which show a close parallel to the edited text.” (_CCSG_ 8)
* _Traditio textus_: “sigla of the manuscripts on which the edition is based are repeated on each page of the edition.” (_CCSG_ 10)
* _Apparatus criticus_
	* Positive ~ negative
	* Complete ~ significant variants (~ orthographic variants)
* _Comparative apparatus_: “If a text survives in different recensions, one of the recensions produces the edited text and it can be decided to give the differences with the other recensions in a _Fassungsapparat_. A similar apparatus can also be included in the case of florilegia, to compare the excerpts with their respective source text.” (_CCSG_ 11)
* _Indirect tradition_: “If a substantial and important indirect tradition of the edited text exists, it may be decided to include the differences between the indirect tradition and the edited text in a separate apparatus.” (_CCSG_ 11)

### A critical look at the critical apparatus

* Advantages: compactness, familiarity
* Disadvantages: compromised legibility, incompleteness

## Reconsidering the role of the apparatus

* The apparatus contains information about variation, sources, etc., selected, ordered, and otherwise mediated by the editor.
* The apparatus *format* is a traditional approach to presenting that information. Other formats are possible.

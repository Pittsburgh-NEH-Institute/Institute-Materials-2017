## Week 2, day 1

* Don’t touch that keyboard! “Making *your* edition”: starting with research questions
* Where data modeling belongs in the work flow
* Markup as an expression of the data model; making the implicit explicit and machine-actionable
* The relationships among model, syntax, and markup semantics
* How modeling reduces iterations of the document analysis → schema development → markup pipeline
* Reconciling community-driven (prescriptive) and research-driven (descriptive) analysis; “how do I do this in X?” vs “how should I model this?”
* Modular development: the digital edition as a computational pipeline
* Modeling in plain text and in XML

## Week 2, day 2

* Understanding modeling perspectives (tree, ranges, graph) and communities
* Modular development: thinking about digital edition development as a computational pipeline
* Beginning to tokenize texts
* Beginning to normalize texts

## Week 2, day 3
* Understanding the principles of basic text transformations like normalization and how they serve different objectives
* Bringing together tokenization and normalization as individual pipeline steps and seeing how they can be implemented in the act of collation
* Normalize, tokenize, and collate text
* Fundamentals of TAG: hypergraph Modeling discontinuity

## Week 2, day 4
* Grasping the concept of modelling text as trees and graphs Understanding annotation as a form of adding layers to text Varieties of layered editions
* Deeper discussion of the alignment step in the GM 
* An awareness of computation to understand that we do near-matching late (in the pipeline) for reasons of efficiency

## Week 2, day 5
* Visualization as part of the text processing pipeline: making decisions, selecting formats, interacting with, and producing visualizations 
* Hands-on: a departure from Word Cloud
* Review of XQuery

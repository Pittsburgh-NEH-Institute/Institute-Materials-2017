# Project planning

## Overview 

* Types of projects: digital textual editions
* Prerequisites: research questions
* Outcome: goals and non-goals (avoiding *scope creep*)
* Logistics: coordinating team members and resources
* The scholarship of editions: data, interpretation, presentation

## General: before you begin

### Start from the outcome of your research goals and work backward

#### Don’t confuse what with how

Outcome goals? Target audiences (*personae*)? 

* **Example:** Instead of thinking that you need a database, think about what the database is supposed to do.

#### Don’t start with specialist consultants

* **Example:** Specialist consultants may think in terms of their specializations, and may recommend specific ways of doing things. Start with the research goals you want to accomplish.

#### Consider the balance between innovation and conformance

* It’s your research, but scholarship happens in communities.

## Stages

### We know about stages from the markup process

* Markup *stages* are really a markup *cycle*: *document analysis* → *schema development* → *markup*

### Stages aren’t strictly sequential

Don’t be this guy: “In Year 1 we’ll prepare our texts, in Year 2 we’ll process them, in Year 3 we’ll publish our results.” Why not?

#### Limitations of stages

* Don’t keep pursuing a dead end. E.g., if you do all your markup before you do any processing, what if you only then discover that you should have done it differently? Or that you need a RDBMS, and not markup at all?
* Don’t fall victim to *scope creep*. Make frequent assessments from overview mode, and don’t get stuck in detail mode. Pursue changes only when they’re realistic, and when you add something, omit something else to make room for it.

#### Advantages of stages

* Where total time is fixed, stages keep you from expending all of your time on the early stages.
* Where individual resources are time-constrained (e.g., the consultant is available only at certain times), plan for it.

## Data resources

What are the data (or *capta*) and how will they be acquired or prepared?

## Human resources

Time and human resource constraints? Technical (e.g., format) or management (e.g., license, privacy) requirements imposed by research context (funding agency, institutional policy, matrix project)?

## Toolkit

* Available and appropriate tools and contexts for acquisition, processing, analysis, and publication.
* Core technologies (e.g., RDBMS, XML, plain text, etc.)? 

## Persistence, interoperability, extensibility

* Integration with other projects? Planning for future growth? Data management or sustainability plan (required by funding agency)?
* **Example:** Linked Open Data (LOD) is meant for interoperation, and it takes your stand-alone project into a community.

## Encyclopedic information

Metadata, bibliography, prosopography (*personography*), gazetteer (*placeography*), etc. Master lists for an entire project, or separates ones for (or within) individual documents? Project-specific or third-party? Reference system? Synchronization within and outside your edition?

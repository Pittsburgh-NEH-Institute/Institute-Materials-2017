# Pedagogical review and rationale

## Week 1: Bootcamp: Computational groundwork skills

### Basic computer skills and humanists

The bootcamp is based on two ideas: 1. Humanists can learn to program, and become adept at it and 2. Programming and encoding are vital to digital edition making. These two ideas ground all other topics taught in the three weeks. The work you undertake here is both achievable and necessary, and you are the only person qualified to determine what that work will entail.

For that reason, we designed the bootcamp to cover basic, necessary skills that you will be able to build on, regardless of what tools you decide to use in the future. Python may very well be useless to you, but regular expressions work in Java (and plenty of other languages) as well. Your project may not have collaborators, but using GitHub gives you as an individual researcher a unique advantage that Dropbox cannot confer: community. As we have emphasized throughout, the bootcamp was not about "tooling up." Rather, we hoped it would give you skills that would make "tooling up" for yourself easier later on in your work process.

The bootcamp was optional because some of you were already familiar with all the material it covered. There were benefits and drawbacks to this decision, and in future versions of this Institute, it may prove more useful to integrate this material in with edition work.

### The mystery of the Internet

We understand that this topic is broad, and a truly useful investigation of this mystery would include a comprehensive history of the Internet, its creators, and its users. Sadly, that was not this lecture. Instead, we aimed to give you a basic idea of what the Internet is and how it does what it does, so that when you begin putting content on it, you understand how its getting there.

In the future, if you'd like to learn or teach more on this subject, we recommend starting with Rus Shuler's [How does the Internet work?](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm), which references other useful resources in its bibliography.

## Week 2: Philcamp: Digital philology, creating a digital edition

### Text-as-Graph and LMNL

In practice, neither of these technologies are developed enough to use as markup strategies. They do provide an alterative to XML that makes you think about why you're modeling a text the way that you are. Does your markup ignore overlapping hierarchy when it could be addressing them with nuance? We did not expect everyone to grasp these concepts, or to be able to use Alexandria flawlessly, on their first try. Instead, we asked that you attempted to challenge your own ideas about what a text is and how it is structured.

## Week 3: Pubcamp: Expressing the edition, digital publication
